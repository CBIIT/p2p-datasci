### What is the NCI Peer-to-Peer Remote Learning Exchange for Data Science?

* This is a new resource for teleworkers that connects NCI staff who want to learn how to use data science (learners) with others at NCI--including those who want to share their knowledge and offer tips for using data science at NCI.

* The Peer-to-Peer Remote Learning Exchange for Data Science also provides collaboration tools and learning resources that are easily accessed remotely.

### How Does It Work? How Can I Join?

* Complete the [registration form](http://bit.ly/NCI_datascience_peer2peer) to tell us the topics you want to focus on, how to contact you, and what collaboration technology you are familiar with or willing to learn.

* After you register, we will help you find other NCI staff who are either learning the same topics or willing to guide you informally in your studies.

### Take Advantage of Learning Resources Across NCI While Working from Home!

* See the [Learning Resources page](../resources) for more information on current online courses, webinars, and tutorials you can participate in remotely.
