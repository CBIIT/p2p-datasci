### How Does it Work? 4 Easy Steps


1. **[Register](http://bit.ly/NCI_datascience_peer2peer) for the Data Science Learning Exchange**. Optional: Watch the [recording](https://cbiit.webex.com/cbiit/lsr.php?RCID=fbbfdd48b30353b99c9a757ff9a2d1d0) of the Kick-off Webinar

2. Look through the list of Learning Resources ([beginner](../beginner-resources), [intermediate/advanced](../intadv-resources)) and [Collaboration Tools](https://cbiit.github.io/p2p-datasci/collabtools/) for more information.

3. Interact with other data science learners, starting with the [Data Science Learning Exchange collaboration hub](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3a82c18d91721048e7a69516e155ac554a%40thread.skype/conversations?groupId=ac0387a5-f532-4379-a234-73eca4399e11&tenantId=14b77578-9773-42d5-8507-251ca2dc2b06) on Microsoft Teams.

4. Find your chosen topic(s) in the [Learning Exchange Microsoft Team](https://bit.ly/2V1k9tj). Look for the channel(s) that correspond to your interests.

5. Learn and engage in dialogue with others in your channel(s) whenever you need help or have tips to share!  

### Tips for Participating in the Learning Exchange

* Data Science is a broad and diverse topic. Like any other skill you learn, it takes a lot of independent study, dedication, and practice.

* You may want to start by creating a learning path to better understand what data science is. Join the [Introduction to Data Science channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a39940aff110c4e1589498daa01d88c07%40thread.skype/Intro%2520to%2520Data%2520Science?groupId=ac0387a5-f532-4379-a234-73eca4399e11&tenantId=14b77578-9773-42d5-8507-251ca2dc2b06) to engage with others and if you're not sure where to start, others with more experience can guide you.

* Once you understand the basics, you can decide how to gain the foundational skills that are important to you. Then you might explore a programming language like R or Python.

* As you begin learning, you will find there are many other people learning the same topics (both in and outside of NCI). The **Data Science Learning Exchange** provides a "brain trust" of peers to share resources, tips, and best practices.

* By sharing what you already know -- in study groups, discussions, tutorials or remote webinars -- not only can your peers learn from you, but their real-world experience may give you new insights to help you find solutions for challenges you have been struggling with.

* Whether you are just beginning or have been learning for a while, **you are in a good position to help others!**
