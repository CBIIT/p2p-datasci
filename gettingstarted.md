### How Does it Work? 5 Easy Steps

1.	[Register](http://bit.ly/NCI_datascience_peer2peer)

2.  After you register, you will receive an email describing next steps

3.  Look through the list of Resources on this website ([beginners](https://cbiit.github.io/p2p-datasci/beginner-resources/)
       & [intermediate/advanced)](https://cbiit.github.io/p2p-datasci/intadv-resources/)

4. Find your chosen topic(s) in the [Learning Exchange Microsoft Team](https://bit.ly/2V1k9tj). Look for the channels that correspond to    your interests.

5. Engage in dialogue with others in your channel!


### Tips for Participating in the Learning Exchange

* Data Science is a broad and diverse topic. Like any other skill you learn -- it takes a lot of independent study, dedication, and practice. The Learning Exchange offers a wealth of  resources so you can choose what, when, and how you want to learn. Explore what is offered and find what works best for you. 

* You may want to start by creating a learning path to better understand what data science is. Join the Introduction to Data Science channel to engage with others who want to get started with data science for tips on how to get started. You can identify what you want to learn first and if you're not sure where to start, others with more experience can guide you. 

* Once you understand the basics, you can decide how to gain the foundational skills that are important to you. Then you might explore a programming language like R or Python. 

You may be a beginner in data analytics, but you may have mastered data science buzzwords and could be a great help to others. By sharing what you already know -- in study groups or discussions -- not only can your peers learn what you already know but their real-world experience may give you insight and solutions for the challenges you face in your work. Advanced practitioners in AI may need guidance in machine learning or a particular deep learning tool to classify molecules for drug development. 

* As you begin learning, you will find there are many other people learning the same topics (both in and outside of NCI). The Learning Exchange provides a "brain trust" of peers who can share tips and resources, and help each other understand concepts and techniques while learning.

* Whether you are just beginning or have been learning for a while, **you are in a good position to help others!**

### Take Advantage of Learning Resources Across NCI While Working from Home!

See [Learning Resources](../resources) and [Collaboration Tools](https://cbiit.github.io/p2p-datasci/collabtools/) for more information.
