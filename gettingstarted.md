## What is the NCI Peer-to-Peer Remote Learning Exchange for Data Science?

* A new resource during telework that connects NCI staff who want to learn how to use data science (learners) with others at NCI (learning guides) who want to share their knowledge and experience in data science at NCI

* Provides collaboration tools and learning resources that are easily accessed remotely

## How Does it Work? How Can I Join?

* Complete the registration form **[add URL]** to tell us the topics you want to focus on, how to contact you, and what collaboration technology you are familiar with or willing to learn: WebEx, Microsoft Teams, email listservs, or other technology.

* After you register, we will help you find other NCI staff who are either learning the same topics or willing to guide you informally in your studies.

## Take Advantage of Learning Resources across NCI During Telework!

* See the Learning Resources page **[add url]** for more information on current online courses, webinars, and tutorials you can participate in remotely!
