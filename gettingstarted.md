### How Does it Work? 5 Easy Steps

1.	[Register](http://bit.ly/NCI_datascience_peer2peer)

2.  After you register, you will receive an email guiding you to resources based on your interests. Proceed with Steps 3 - 5 at any         time!

3.  Look through the list of Resources on this website ([beginners](https://cbiit.github.io/p2p-datasci/beginner-resources/)
       & [intermediate/advanced)](https://cbiit.github.io/p2p-datasci/intadv-resources/)

4. Find your chosen topic(s) in the [Learning Exchange Microsoft Team](https://bit.ly/2V1k9tj). Look for the channels that correspond to    your interests.

5. Engage in dialogue with others in your channel!


### Tips for Participating in the Learning Exchange

* Data Science is a broad and diverse topic. Like any other skill you learn -- it takes a lot of independent study, dedication, and practice. 

* You may want to start by creating a learning path to better understand what data science is. Join the Introduction to Data Science channel to engage with others and if you're not sure where to start, others with more experience can guide you. 

* Once you understand the basics, you can decide how to gain the foundational skills that are important to you. Then you might explore a programming language like R or Python. 

* As you begin learning, you will find there are many other people learning the same topics (both in and outside of NCI). The Data Science Learning Exchange provides a "brain trust" of peers who can share tips and resources, help each other understand concepts, and techniques, and share insights and solutions for similar challenges.


* You may be a beginner in data analytics, but you may have mastered data science buzzwords and could be a great help to others. Or you may have advanced skills in some areas, but need additional skills. By sharing what you already know -- in study groups, discussions, tutorials or remote webinars -- not only can your peers learn what you already know but their real-world experience may give you insight and solutions for challenges you have been struggling with. 

* Whether you are just beginning or have been learning for a while, **you are in a good position to help others!**

### Take Advantage of Learning Resources Across NCI While Working from Home!

See [Learning Resources](../resources) and [Collaboration Tools](https://cbiit.github.io/p2p-datasci/collabtools/) for more information.
