## Getting Started Building Your Data Science Toolkit

Congratulations on choosing to build your data science toolkit!  There are many people in NCI just like you, and the Peer-to-Peer Remote Learning Exchange for Data Science will help you learn with and from each other.

This Learning Exchange works by matching people with similiar interests into pairs or study groups.  Your learning will primarily be on your own, but your peers and some guides will be there to answer questions, provide suggestions, and help keep you motivated.  Please make an effort to help out others as well!

To get started, just let us know what topics you are interested in and whether you want to learn, help others, or both.

Topics might include:
* introduction to programming, with Python, R, Perl, Bash or other languages.
* how to use Biowulf, NIH's high-powered compute cluster
* managing and collaborating with other coders using Git or Github 
* ...

Once you have registered by letting us know your interests, we will find others with matching interests.  You may then interact with them by email, Webex, or using other remote collaboration tools of your choice.

Use this form to register: [registration form](../register)

If you decide at any time that you want to change your listed interests, just fill out the form again or email us.

Then, to get started learning, reach out to your peers or take a look at our [list of suggested learning resources](../resources).
