### What is the NCI Peer-to-Peer Remote Learning Exchange for Data Science?

* This program is a resource for teleworkers that connects NCI staff who want to learn how to use data science (learners) with others at NCI, including those who want to share their knowledge and experience with data science at NCI.

* It provides collaboration tools and learning resources that are easily accessed remotely.

### How Does It Work? How Can I Join?

* Complete the registration form **[add URL]** to tell us the topics you want to focus on, how to contact you, and what collaboration technologies you are familiar with or willing to learn.

* After you register, we will help you find other NCI staff who are either learning the same topics or willing to guide you informally in your studies.

### Take Advantage of Learning Resources Across NCI While You Telework!

* See the [Learning Resources page](../resources) for more information on current online courses, webinars, and tutorials you can participate in remotely.
