### Tips for Learning and Helping Others Learn

* Data Science is like any other skill you learn -- it takes a lot of independent study and practice.  The first step to benefiting from this Learning Exchange is to commit to the effort you will need to expend.

* You may want to begin by creating a learning path.  Start with understanding what data science is (including the fact that data science is a broad and diverse topic), and then identify some specific foundational skills that you can start learning.  Learning data-oriented use of a programming language like R or Python is a one good example starting point.

* As you begin learning, you will find that there are many other people learning the same topics (both in and outside of NCI).  The Learning Exchange is intended to provide you with a peer environment in which you can share tips and resources, and help each other understand concepts and techniques while learning.

* Whether you are just beginning or have been learning for a while, **you are in a good position to help others!**
