### What is the NCI Peer-to-Peer Remote Learning Exchange for Data Science?

* This is a new resource for teleworkers. It connects NCI staff who want to learn how to use data science (learners) with other learners at NCI --- and with those who want to share their experience in using data science at NCI (learning guides).

* It also provides collaboration tools and learning resources that are easily accessed remotely.

* The learning guides are volunteers in these activities. Through different means of communications, they will provide insights and resources for learners. We plan to have several guides per data science category. The guides are  expected to not spend significant time on these activities, and be available to answer questions from learners.

### How Does It Work? How Can I Join?

* Complete the [registration form](http://bit.ly/NCI_datascience_peer2peer) to tell us the topics you want to focus on, how to contact you, and what collaboration technology you are familiar with or willing to learn.

* After you register, we will help you find other NCI staff who are either learning the same topics or willing to guide you informally in your studies.

### Tips for Learning and Helping Others Learn

* Data Science is like any other skill you learn -- it takes a lot of independent study and practice.  The first step to benefiting from this Learning Exchange is to commit to the effort you will need to expend.

* You may want to begin by creating a learning path.  Start with understanding what data science is (including the fact that data science is a broad and diverse topic), and then identify some specific foundational skills that you can start learning.  Learning data-oriented use of a programming language like R or Python is a one good example starting point.

* As you begin learning, you will find that there are many other people learning the same topics (both in and outside of NCI).  The Learning Exchange is intended to provide you with a peer environment in which you can share tips and resources, and help each other understand concepts and techniques while learning.

* Whether you are just beginning or have been learning for a while, **you are in a good position to help others!**

### Take Advantage of Learning Resources Across NCI While Working from Home!

See the [Learning Resources page](../resources) for more information on current online courses, webinars, and tutorials you can participate in remotely.
