## Resources for Learning and Practicing SQL

This list of of resources is based on contributions from SQL learners and advanced users like you.  Community discussion and mutual support for SQL learners is on the MS Teams site, under the [SQL channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a55834aad5a334e46b7fa716626505f0f%40thread.skype/SQL?groupId=ac0387a5-f532-4379-a234-73eca4399e11&tenantId=14b77578-9773-42d5-8507-251ca2dc2b06).

### Getting Started with SQL

**SQLite** A great tool for beginning SQL is a lightweight database called [SQLite](https://www.sqlite.org) that you can run on your desktop.  SQLite is free and runs on Windows, Mac, Linux and more.

Freecodecamp.org offers a 4-hour video [Introduction to SQL and Databases](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/sql-and-databases-full-course/). This tutorial uses MySQL (another free database that you can install on your own). Once you complete this course, freecodecamp.org has a great "[Basic SQL Commands](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/basic-sql-commands/)" reference that should help as you start practicing.
