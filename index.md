### Challenge yourself to learn data science skills while helping your NCI peers learn!

**[Register here](http://bit.ly/NCI_datascience_peer2peer)** 


* The Data Science Learning Exchange connects NCI staff who want to learn how to use data science in their work with other learners â€” and     with data science "veterans" who want to share their experience. 

* This is a self-determined, self-sustaining community that grows and evolves to meet the needs of the participants. This website provides learning resources and collaboration tools that are easily accessed remotely.

### Connect with others across NCI to learn data science skills that can help you in your work and share your experience to help others!
