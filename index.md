### Challenge yourself to learn data science skills while helping your NCI peers learn!

**[Register here](http://bit.ly/NCI_datascience_peer2peer)!** 


* Connect with NCI staff who want to learn how to use data science â€” and with NCI data science "veterans" who want to share their knowledge and experience. 

* This is a self-determined, self-sustaining community that will grow and evolve to meet the needs of the participants. This website provides learning resources and collaboration tools that are easily accessed remotely.

* The Learning Exchange offers a wealth of resources so you can choose what, when, and how you want to learn. Explore the resources, exchange information, and find what works best for you.

### Connect with others across NCI to learn data science skills that can help you in your work and share your experience to help others!
