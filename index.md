### Challenge yourself to learn data science skills while helping your NCI peers learn!

**[Register here](http://bit.ly/NCI_datascience_peer2peer)** for the Data Science Learning Exchange.


* The Learning Exchange connects NCI staff who want to learn how to use data science in their work with other learnersâ€” and with experienced others who want to share their experience in data science.

* The learning exchange is intended as a self-determined, self-sustaining and growing community to meet the needs of the participants. This website provides learning resources and collaboration tools that are easily accessed remotely.

### Connect with others across NCI to learn data science skills that can help you in your work and share your experience to help others!
