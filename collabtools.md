### Microsoft Teams

[Microsoft Teams](https://teams.microsoft.com) is the main collaboration hub for the NCI Data Science Learning Exchange.

Here you will find a "channel" for each study group so you can chat and share information and resources.

See the [short tutorial](https://teams.microsoft.com/_#/conversations/General?threadId=19:5c0d65c54a874a3fbefc2c2a75d82694@thread.skype&ctx=channel) about how to get started with Microsoft Teams.


### Webex

* Join Webex sessions created by others by simply clicking on a link.
* Request a [Host Account](https://service.cancer.gov/ncisp?id=nci_sc_cat_item&sys_id=1d83eb95dbd1c3002f4e75131f9619f3) so you can host meetings.
* Create your own Webex [personal room](https://service.cancer.gov/ncisp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=NCI-KB0013840).


### Jabber

* Use [Jabber](https://service.cancer.gov/ncisp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=NCI-KB0013219), NCI's instant messaging and collaboration tool.


### Email Listservs

**Listservs** allow you to participate in group discussions over email.  A listserv can be configured to maintain a searchable archive of past emails.  Note that once created, anyone in NIH (not just NCI) can request to join.

* [Sign up](https://list.nih.gov) for an NIH Listserv account.
* [Create](https://service.cancer.gov) a listserv for a new study group.
