### Webex

* Join Webex sessions created by others by simply clicking on a link
* Request a [Host Account](https://service.cancer.gov/ncisp?id=nci_sc_cat_item&sys_id=1d83eb95dbd1c3002f4e75131f9619f3) so you can host meeting.
* Create your own Webex [personal room](https://service.cancer.gov/ncisp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=NCI-KB0013840).

### Jabber

* Use [Jabber](https://service.cancer.gov/ncisp?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=NCI-KB0013219), NCI's instant messaging and collaboration tool.

### Email Listservs and Distribution Lists

**Listservs** allow you to participate in group discussions over email.

* [Sign up](https://list.nih.gov) for an NIH Listserv account.
* Find existing listservs relevant to Data Science on the [Resources](../resources) page.
* [Create](https://service.cancer.gov) a list for a new study group.

**Distribution Lists** (DLs) are like Listservs, but simpler; good for small groups.

* [Create](https://service.cancer.gov) a Distribution List.
