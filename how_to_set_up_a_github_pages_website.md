# How to set up a GitHub Pages website

Create an empty public repository on GitHub, e.g., `https://github.com/CBIIT/p2p-datasci` or `https://github.com/andrew-weisman/p2p-datasci-test` (this repository).

The instructions below are loosely based on those [here](https://github.com/daattali/beautiful-jekyll). [Here](https://deanattali.com) is a non-VPN-blocked example of what the template can deliver. Recently, the NIH VPN has blocked the [actual demo site](https://beautifuljekyll.com) for this template.

Create and switch to a `gh-pages` branch in your new repository (note you may have to first initialize the repository by creating an initial commit):

```bash
git branch gh-pages
git checkout gh-pages
```
