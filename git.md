## Resources for Learning and Practicing Git and Github 

This list of of resources is based on contributions from Git and Github learners and advanced users like you.  Community discussion and mutual support for Git learners is on the MS Teams site, under the [Git channel](https://teams.microsoft.com/l/channel/19%3a02b26a58a8334546bfb0531da9a363f4%40thread.skype/Git%2520and%2520GitHub?groupId=ac0387a5-f532-4379-a234-73eca4399e11&tenantId=14b77578-9773-42d5-8507-251ca2dc2b06).

### Getting Started with Git 

Git is a source code management software that supports sharing and collaborating on code and data with other developers and data scientists.  Whether you are working with Python, R or any other language, Git will maintain a version history of your work and allow you to branch and merge different revisions of that body of code files, including mixing in contributions from multiple developers working anywhere in the world.

Git is possibly *the* most widely used tool among data scientists, so it is well worth your time to become familiar with it.  Git is one of the most common ways you will collaborate with other data scientists.

Git is a command line tool, but [Github.com](https://github.com) is a extremely popular website that provides a simple GUI interface to Git's features.  Many people use Github almost exclusively and never touch Git directly.

Whether you use Git from the command line or through Github, you will need to understand how Git works.

To learn Git for the command line, try (freecodecamp.org's Git tutorial)[https://guide.freecodecamp.org/git/].

To learn about Github, try this [Hello World](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/) and then [these other](https://guides.github.com/).
