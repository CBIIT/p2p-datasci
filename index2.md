Are you interested in learning about data science or helping your NCI peers learn? 
Here is the registration form: link [add URL – I will be sending you content for this form].  
•	Choose the topics you want to focus on, how to contact you, and what collaboration technology you are familiar with or willing to learn, such as WebEx, Microsoft Teams, email listservs, or other technology. 
•	We will compile a list and help you find other NCI staff who are either learning the same topics or willing to guide you informally in your studies.
