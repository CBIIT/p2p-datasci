**Overview:**  
Hosted by NIH.AI and National Library of Medicine (NLM), this highly interactive workshop offered opportunities to exchange expertise and collaborate with NIH researchers at all career levels who are utilizing natural language processing technologies in their work. This four-hour workshop included targeted presentations with time for open discussion among peers and across disciplines. 

Topics included:

--*Text Mining and Deep Learning for Biology and Healthcare: An Introduction*

--*Automatic information extraction from free-text pathology reports using multi-task convolutional neural networks*

--*Biomedical Named Entity Recognition and Information Extraction*

--*Neural Approaches to Medical Question Understanding*

-*Transfer Learning in Biomedical NLP: A Case Study with BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)*
