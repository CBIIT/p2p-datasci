The Linux "shell" is the command-line interface to the Linux operating system. It is built into all Linux systems, from Android devices to the world's largest supercomputers, including NIH's Biowulf. In this **six-week series of two-hour workshops**, we will introduce the Bash, by far the most popular version of the Linux shell and a useful scripting language for Linux.

Instructors will use the Linux terminal and you will follow along on a remote Linux system accessible by all course registrants course, allowing you to gain a strong foundation in the fundamentals of and best practices for using Linux.

***NOTE***: **This is a six-part course, held weekly for 6 weeks from 11 am – 1 pm, with a 20-minute lunch break**. When you register, you are registering for all six weeks. Please make sure you have time in your schedule to commit to all six sessions!

**Registration is required**; the link will be posted shortly.
