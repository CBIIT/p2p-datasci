The Linux "shell" is the command-line interface to the Linux operating system. It is built in to all Linux systems, from Android devices to the world's largest supercomputers, including NIH's Biowulf cluster.

In this **six-week series of two-hour workshops**, we will introduce Bash, by far the most popular version of the Linux shell and a useful scripting language for Linux. Instructors will use the Linux terminal and you will follow along on a remote Linux system accessible by all course registrants, allowing you to gain a strong foundation in the fundamentals of and best practices for using Linux.

***NOTE***: **This is a six-part course, held weekly for six weeks from 11 am – 1 pm, with a 20-minute lunch break**. When you register, you are registering for all six weeks. Please make sure you have time in your schedule to commit to all six sessions!

**Registration is required**; the link will be posted here shortly.

* **Software Carpentry Lesson**: *[The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice)*

**Before the workshop**: We will use a Linux virtual machine (VM) for this workshop. All registrants will receive access to this VM for the duration of each workshop. Instructions will be sent out for participants to test out logging in to the VM before 9/21 so that we can jump right in to the course material.
