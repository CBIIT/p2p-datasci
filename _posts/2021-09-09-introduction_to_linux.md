**Join the Software Carpentry Series of Hands-on Workshops to learn how to use the Linux Shell for Data Science!**

The Linux "shell" is the command-line interface to the Linux operating system. It is built in to all Linux systems, from Android devices to the world's largest supercomputers, including NIH's Biowulf cluster.

In this **four-week series of two-hour workshops**, we will introduce Bash, by far the most popular version of the Linux shell and a useful scripting language for Linux. Instructors will use the Linux terminal and you will follow along on a remote Linux system accessible by all course registrants, allowing you to gain a strong foundation in the fundamentals of and best practices for using Linux.

**NOTE:** **This is a four-part course, held weekly for four weeks from 11 am – 1 pm, with a 20-minute lunch break**. When you register, you are registering for all four weeks. Please make sure you have time in your schedule to commit to all four sessions!

**Registration is required**; please register [here](https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=eHW3FHOX1UKFByUcotwrBmZTSnRbXM9JpWdlqxYLNZxUOUg3VEFaRzMyRDBUTEhETzQxSklERDlXVS4u).

**Workshop Recordings and Materials:**

* **Recordings and Files:** *[Course folder on GitHub](https://github.com/CBIIT/p2p-datasci/tree/master/workshop_materials/2021-09-21-introduction_to_linux)*
* **Software Carpentry Lesson:** *[The Unix Shell](http://swcarpentry.github.io/shell-novice)*

**Before the workshop:** We will use a Linux virtual machine (VM) for this workshop. All registrants will receive access to this VM for the duration of each workshop. Instructions will be sent out for participants to test out logging in to the VM before 9/21 so that we can jump right in to the course material.

**Presenters:** Andrew Weisman, PhD, HPC Analyst; [George Zaki, PhD](https://www.linkedin.com/in/george-zaki-361b2131/), Bioinformatics Manager, Frederick National Laboratory for Cancer Research ([FNLCR](https://frederick.cancer.gov))
