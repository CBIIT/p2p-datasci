Are you interested in improving your machine or deep learning models? You often cannot be sure you've developed the best model without performing hyperparameter optimization. In this talk, we will explain what this crucial procedure is and how to perform it with only minimal effort using the [CANDLE](https://datascience.cancer.gov/collaborations/joint-design-advanced-computing/candle) open-source software platform on NIH's Biowulf supercomputer. We will also provide an overview of what machine learning is, how it relates to deep learning, and how to get started!
