Have you wondered how the epidemiological data for COVID-19 is being collected and disseminated nationwide? Or how the disease trajectory compares to other diseases during the same time period?

Join a **virtual webinar** on Jun 24 to learn how the new [Mortality Tracker](https://episphere.github.io/mortalitytracker) designed by DCEG scientists is being used across the country and how it was developed using Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, Reusable (F.A.I.R.) principles.

#### Abstract

In response to the urgent need for portable real-time epidemiological data analysis, DCEG scientists designed a real-time [Mortality Tracker](https://episphere.github.io/mortalitytracker) for COVID-19 and other diseases in the United States. This new data distribution method intersects epidemiology, Cloud and web computing to monitor the broader impact of COVID-19 on death rates across the United States.

Overview
This two-part workshop will introduce you to the concepts and tools in Machine Learning to generate molecular descriptors for drug function classification. You will receive hands-on instruction to generate and explore small molecule (drug-like) chemical structures, compute chemical descriptors, and create and analyze Machine Learning classification models. The workshop will use open source chemoinformatics software and the scikit-learn library to compute key pharma-relevant descriptors and generate/analyze drug classification models. 

Part 1: a 30-minute presentation followed by a 20-minute hands-on code/tools review. This includes:
•	Introduction to ML concepts to create molecular structures and extract features or chemical descriptors. 
•	How to generate and analyze molecular fingerprint descriptors
•	 How to use the following two tools to explore data (chemical) analysis and feature generation:

o	Rdkit libraries, Python’s open source cheminformatics software toolkit
o	Mordred and other open source software to generate molecular features

Part 2: a 30-minute presentation followed by a 20-minute hands-on tools review. In Part 2, we will extend the concepts demonstrated in Part 1 to build machine learning classification models for predicting small-molecule (drug-like) function (ex., CNS, GI Agent, etc.). Tools include: 

•	Scikit-learn for creating Random Forest classification models
•	A modeling workflow that include data collection/curation, featurization (fingerprints), classification modeling using ensemble-based methods and analysis and based on the lessons-learned from AMPL publication
