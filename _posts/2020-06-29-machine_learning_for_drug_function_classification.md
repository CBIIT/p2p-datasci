**Overview:** This two-part workshop will introduce you to the concepts and tools in Machine Learning to generate molecular descriptors for drug function classification. You will receive hands-on instruction to generate and explore small molecule (drug-like) chemical structures, compute chemical descriptors, and create and analyze Machine Learning classification models. The workshop will use open source chemoinformatics software and the [scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable) library to compute key pharma-relevant descriptors and generate/analyze drug classification models.

**Part 1:** a 30-minute presentation followed by a 20-minute hands-on code/tools review. This includes:

- Introduction to ML concepts to create molecular structures and extract features or chemical descriptors.
- How to generate and analyze molecular fingerprint descriptors
- How to use the following two tools to explore data (chemical) analysis and feature generation:
  - [Rdkit libraries](https://www.rdkit.org), Python’s open source cheminformatics software toolkit
  - [Mordred](https://jcheminf.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s13321-018-0258-y) and other open source software to generate molecular features

**Part 2:** a 30-minute presentation followed by a 20-minute hands-on tools review. We will extend the concepts demonstrated in **Part 1** to build machine learning classification models for predicting small-molecule (drug-like) function (ex., CNS, GI Agent, etc.). Tools include:

- [Scikit-learn](https://scikit-learn.org/stable) for creating Random Forest classification models
- A modeling workflow that include data collection/curation, featurization (fingerprints), classification modeling using ensemble-based methods and analysis and based on the lessons-learned from [AMPL](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32243153) publication

**Date:** Thursday, July 16, 2020
