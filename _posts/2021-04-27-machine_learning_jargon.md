Are you clear on how deep learning fits into machine learning? Confused about the difference between training, testing, and validation datasets? Join us for an overview of terminology commonly heard when machine learning is discussed. While this is not a formal introduction to machine learning, we will do our best to introduce the concepts in a logical order, and newcomers to the field may further benefit by gaining some degree of familiarity with machine learning jargon.
