**Overview:** This two-part workshop will demonstrate how deep learning can be used to classify different types of cancer. 
Part I will focus on data preparation, starting with genomic data. Part II will demonstrate how to create a deep learning model, with hands-on instruction on how to use the processed data to build a convolutional neural network (CNN) model that can classify different cancer types.
You can see preliminary workshop materials—Jupyter notebooks and documentation—on Github, at [https://github.com/ravichas/ML-TC1](https://github.com/ravichas/ML-TC1). 
 
Please join us!
