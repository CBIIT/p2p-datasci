Python is a good programming language for scientists to solve a wide variety of biological problems. We find that many scientists who come to Software Carpentry workshops use Python and want to learn more.

If you are a novice and want to learn how to program in Python to help you in your work, please join our ***NEW six-week series of two-hour workshops!*** Instructors will use live code and you will follow along on your own computer. You will gain a strong foundation in the fundamentals of Python along with best practices for scientific computing: breaking down analyses into modular units, task automation, and encapsulation.
